# Math Work

## Introduction

I like doing math, and sometimes when working on a problem, or sometimes an
assortment of problems, I like to cleanly write down my calculations in a PDF
annotator app I have on my phone. The result ends up being a decently cool
looking and compact way of storing my math work.

This repository is mostly going to be an archive of these PDFs or just a place
to show them off.

## Examples

**The uniform probability variable problem**: This details my work in deriving
using probabilistic means only the probability that given $n$ uniformly
distributed random variables $x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n \in [0, 1]$,
$$x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_n \ge 1.$$

**The Calc pdf**: This was really my first large collection of math work, where
I organized everything into boxes and tried to make things look as pretty as
possible. It's quite funny honestly to see how each of the little topics
eventually evolved along with my handwriting (the more spaced out the
handwriting the older the box). There are also some little embarrassing things
(see my "proof" of the fundamental theorem of calculus), but I guess we all have those.
