# Math Work

I like doing math, and sometimes when working on a problem, or sometimes an
assortment of problems, I like to cleanly write down my calculations in a PDF
annotator app I have on my phone. The result ends up being a decently cool
looking and compact way of storing my math work.

This repository is mostly going to be an archive of these PDFs or just a place
to show them off.
