# Math Work

## Introduction

I like doing math, and sometimes when working on a problem, or sometimes an
assortment of problems, I like to cleanly write down my calculations in a PDF
annotator app I have on my phone. The result ends up being a decently cool
looking and compact way of storing my math work.

This repository is mostly going to be an archive of these PDFs or just a place
to show them off.

## Examples

**The uniform probability variable problem**: This details my work in deriving
using probabilistic means only the probability that given $n$ uniformly
distributed random variables $x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n$,
$$x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_n \ge 1.$$
